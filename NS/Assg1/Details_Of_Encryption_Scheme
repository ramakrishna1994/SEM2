Details Of Encryption Scheme

Steps performed in encryption are given as below.

Assuming key as "EDGARCODD" and plain text as "MauriceVincent"

Step-1 : Applying Vignere Cipher Encryption Procedure using given key.
            Key is repeated until it matches with the length of plain text

            a) From the plain text all the special characters and numbers will
                be removed.
            b) All the small letters are converted into capital letters.
            c) Now key will be repeated to match the length of plain text.
            d) Vignere Cipher Encryption procedure is applied.
            e) All the characters which were previously converted to capital
                will be converted back to small letters.

          (PLAIN TEXT  AFTER
          REMOVING SPECIAL
          CHARACTERS AND NUMBERS)   : MauriceVincent..........
          CAPITAL CONVERSION        : MAURICEVINCENT..........
          KEY (REPEATED)            : EDGARCODDEDGAR..........
          VIGNERE CIPHER TEXT       : QDARZESYLRFKNK..........
          SMALL CONVERSION          : QdarzesYlrfknk..........

         Vignere cipher encryption procedure only works with capital letters. So any
         small letter encountered will be converted to capital first , then encrypted
         and then converted to small again.

Step-2 : Now applying Shift cipher procedure which shifts the Vignere cipher by 0,1,2,3...
            in lengths of key.In this case in lengths of 9.

            a) The output from the first step is taken and the characters in the cipher are
                shifted forward (Addition) by 0,1,2,3 in lengths of 9 as given below.
            b) Shift cipher encryption procedure is applied and final cipher is obtained.
            c) All the special characters and numbers which were removed previously will be
                added back.

           SMALL CIPHER TEXT        : QdarzesYlrfknk..........
           SHIFT CIPHER             : 00000000011111.......... (ADDITION)
           (FINAL CIPHER TEXT
           With SPECIAL CHARACTERS
           AND NUMBERS)             : QdarzesYlsglol..........

Step-3 : Now the final cipher text is encrypted using h20171030081 public key.
